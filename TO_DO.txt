- Add docstrings and README.MD
- Add more models
- Change the theta variable to a dictionary with the actual names of 
  the variables
- Add more distributions
- Change the GARCH models so they can dynamically account for more lagged terms
- Change the way in which the bounds are chosen
- Experiment with other optimiation algorithms
- Implement GAS models

- Implement Kalman Filter for structural break detection

* NOTE: Some of the other distributions have parameters that 
	also have to be optimized. These parameters should also 
	be included in the variable dictionary.
